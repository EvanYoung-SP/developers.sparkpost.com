### Whatâ€™s New?

* Smart Send launched as a [SparkPost Labs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/labs-introduction.html) feature. This [Transmissions API](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/transmissions.html) option will not attempt to send to any recipients who have not engaged (received messages but not open or clicked) in at least 6 months. More details in the [blog post](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/smart-send/). 
  * NOTE: Not yet available in the EU. Enterprise customers, please contact your TAM for information on how to enable this option.
