### Fixed

* *Keep me logged in* now keeps you logged in in the web UI
* SMTP configuration info mysteriously disappeared from the UI... it's back!

* We no longer require the existence of k=rsa when verifying DKIM for a sending domain
* When trying to create a sending domain on a subaccount and specifying shared_with_subaccounts = false, we now return a 400 (instead of a 500)
* When trying a PUT call to the transmissions API, we now return a 405 (instead of a 500)
