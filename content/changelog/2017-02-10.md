### What's New?

* You can now update your account-level options such as SMTP engagement tracking and API engagement tracking through the API using the [Account update endpoint](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/account.html#account-update-put).

### Fixed

* We corrected an issue where web UI assets were being improperly cached. For those of you that saw the red bar of doom at the top of the screen, a hard refresh was required.
