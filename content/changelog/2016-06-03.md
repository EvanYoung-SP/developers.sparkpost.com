### What's New?

* The "Oh Snap!" error messages weren't too helpful - we now surface 4xx errors and include the error message, code, and description in the big red error bar
* Our API docs are now static HTML files - they load a LOT faster and work on mobile devices now
* The webhooks batch status now shows the previous failure after the webhook starts to be successfully delivered again
* You can now use substitution variables in the from domain in the templates web UI
* We've given the [C# client library](https://github.com/darrencauthon/csharp-sparkpost) back to you, the community, with @darrencauthon at the helm

### Fixed

* The Oauth2 authentication method for webhooks is properly refreshing tokens again (thanks @qianyu6688999, et. al.!)
* When templates contained an image as the first element, our preview in the web UI was getting cut off - no more!
* We squashed the pesky that was causing 500 errors when creating multiple subaccounts programmatically
