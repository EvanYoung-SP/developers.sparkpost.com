### What's New?

* Released version 1.0.0 of [nodemailer-sparkpost-transport](https://github.com/SparkPost/nodemailer-sparkpost-transport), which now properly implements the nodemailer API
* Released version 2.0.3 of [php-sparkpost](https://github.com/SparkPost/php-sparkpost), which removed any dependency on Guzzle by replacing it with `MessageFactoryDiscovery`

### Fixed

* We now properly validate long-format emails (like `Homer Simpson <homer.simpson@springfield.org>`) in the Reply-To field in templates in the app

### What's New?

* Paid accounts can purchase sending IPs in the app! Time for an IP!
* You can now [manage your suppression list](https://app.sparkpost.com/lists/suppressions) in the app.

### Fixed

* Itâ€™s no longer possible to attempt to share a sending domain with all subaccounts and specify a specific subaccount - the two are mutually exclusive
