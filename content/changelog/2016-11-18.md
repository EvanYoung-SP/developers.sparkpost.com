### What's New?

* We added advanced filtering to the [message events](https://app.sparkpost.com/reports/message-events) in the app, which allows you to filter by from addresses, event types, templates, subaccounts, campaigns, and message IDs.
* Migrating from SendGrid to SparkPost? We put together a [SendGrid migration guide](https://www.sparkpost.com/migration-guides/sendgrid/) to help you along the way.
* Released [python-sparkpost 1.3.2](https://github.com/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/releases), with fixes to cc/bcc handling and instructions for use with Google App Engine.
* [Updates](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/suppression-list-api-updates/) to suppression list for API and UI

### Fixed

* Our webhooks started sending the bounce_class field along as an integer when it should have stayed a string. The field is now behaving properly.
