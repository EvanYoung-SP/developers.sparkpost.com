### What’s New?

* You now have the ability to set up secure engagement tracking links using a custom tracking domain, [Check it out](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/tech-resources/enabling-https-engagement-tracking-on-sparkpost/).
* On the Transmissions API, a GET request will only return scheduled transmissions.
* Minor change - On the Tracking Domains API, a GET request for newly verified Tracking Domains will return a blank CNAME_status (rather than cname_status of “verified”). For verified tracking domains, the VERIFIED field will still be set to TRUE.
