### Whatâ€™s New?

* Improved support documentation with a cleaner look and better search. We also open sourced the documentation- pull requests welcome!
* You can now create multiple bounce domains for your sending domains using the sending domain [REST API](https://developer.sparkpost.com/api/sending-domains.html). [More Info](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/tech-resources/custom-bounce-domain/)

### Fixed

* A defect was fixed to ensure when customers inject a multi-recipient transmission using REST, the Message-ID header in the email will be unique.
