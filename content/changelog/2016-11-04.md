### What's New?

* Released [node-sparkpost 2.0.0](https://github.com/SparkPost/node-sparkpost) - major version bump with huge feature, usability and maintainability improvements! Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/SparkPost/node-sparkpost/releases/tag/v2.0.0) for all the delicious details.
* Released [elixir-sparkpost 0.2.1](http://github.com/SparkPost/elixir-sparkpost) - huge thanks to @david.antaramian!
* If you’ve ever wanted to view a sending domain’s DKIM settings after it’s been verified, you can do that now.

### Fixed

* Transactional / non-transactional flags are now set correctly when importing CSVs for suppression lists in the app. Excel auto-upcases boolean values, and we weren’t accounting for that.
* Messages to inbound domains no longer incorrectly move `cc` recipients into the `to` array of relay webhook payloads.
