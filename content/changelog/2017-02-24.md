### What's New?

* You can now update your suppression list in real-time! No more waiting for edits to take effect
* We have a shiny new SparkPost Labs A/B test API ([docs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/ab-testing.html))
* We sped up the SparkPost API, especially for small transmissions and sending from Europe.
* When creating sending domains, we clarified our requirements to help make the process easier
* If you lose your device, you can now disable 2fa by re-entering your password (backup codes are coming soon).
* We now accept any inbound messages sent to abuse@<bounce_domain> or postmaster@<bounce_domain> and forward them to abuse@sparkpost.com or postmaster@sparkpost.com
