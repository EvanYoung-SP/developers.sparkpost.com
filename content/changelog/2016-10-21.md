### What's New?

* Improved DKIM validation in the Sending Domains API by ensuring that submitted public and private keys match
* Released version 2.5.0 of our [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/SparkPost/wordpress-sparkpost/releases/tag/2.5.0), which adds support for transactional email and hooks

### Fixed

* Our [DKIM Validator Tool](https://www.sparkpost.com/resources/tools/dkim-tool/) now properly shows the `Sender` as the value of the `From` header on the test results page
