### What Changed?

* We changed the "rate" type metrics in the Summary Report to use "Sent" or "Accepted" as the denominator, rather than "Targeted" across the board.
  * This will make Open Rate, Click Rate, and Bounce Rates higher since there's a lower number in the denominator. The counts have not changed.
  * This is a UI-only change. There are no "rate" metrics in webhooks or Message Events
  * You can read about the rationale for these changes in this [blog post](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/metrics-calculation-update/)
