### What's New?

* Simplified the way you verify ownership of your sending domains with SparkPost. We removed the redundant SPF-based verification mechanism on the "sending domains" page.
* Out of band events - outofband, list, link, feedback, open, and click - are now enriched with more data from the originating delivery event. You can hit the events samples endpoints for [message events](https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/message-events/events/samples?event=outofband) or [webhooks](https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/webhooks/events/samples?event=outofband) to see sample data.
* Released [php-sparkpost 2.1.0](https://github.com/SparkPost/php-sparkpost/releases) with lots of little fixes, a new debug option to see the full request sent to SparkPost, and updates to ensure compatibility with php 7.
* Released [python-sparkpost 1.3.3](https://github.com/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/releases) with a fix to properly surface some underlying API errors.
* Released node-sparkpost 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 with minor fixes and an update to our handling of promises.

### Fixed

* You can now filter the message events in the app by generation rejection.
* We now make sure all emails uploaded to a suppression list are lower-cased before saving them.
