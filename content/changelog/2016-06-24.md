### What's New?

* Version 2.0 of the PHP client library has arrived! Note that this is a major release with breaking changes to the interface. It has been renamed sparkpost/sparkpost. Feedback welcome!
* We now show Timestamp, Event, Campaign, Friendly From, Recipient, Message ID, Bounce Reason, and Bounce Classification Code as the columns in the Message Events report in the app

### Fixed

* The `sending_ip` key in webhooks and message events is no longer coming through as “shared” when using the sp_shared IP pool
