### What's New?

* Configure IP pools using the app or the the IP Pools API ([docs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/ip-pools.html))
* Manage dedicated sending IPs using the Sending IPs API ([docs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/sending-ips.html))
* Configure a custom bounce domain for your account using the app or the Bounce Domains API ([docs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/bounce-domains.html))
* Messages are now accepted and queued for a max of 24 hours for accounts that are suspended
* We now bill accounts for overages when they reach $100 or more

### Fixed

* SPF settings in the app no longer show an insanely long list of ip4: values
* The bounce domains API now returns more than just `{}` on creation
* Errors encountered when editing IP pools in the app now properly display error information
* The recipient list API now returns a 4xx instead of a 500 when the JSON format is invalid
* Tables in our API docs now display properly on mobile devices
