description: Manage your suppression list - a list of recipient email addresses to which you do NOT want to send email.

# Group Suppression List

A suppression list - or exclusion list, as it is sometimes called - stores a recipient's opt-out preferences. It is a list of recipient email addresses to which you do NOT want to send email. The Suppression List API is used to manage your exclusion list entries.  An entry indicates whether the recipient opted out of receiving one of the following:

* Transactional messages
* Non-transactional messages

Transactional messages are single recipient messages that are used operationally, e.g. to reset a password or confirm a purchase; while non-transactional messages are used to run email campaigns where a list of recipients are targeted, e.g. advertising a sales event.

In addition to your suppression list, SparkPost maintains a global suppression list across all customers.

## Recipient Database Maintenance

<banner status="info">When setting up your SparkPost account, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you import any suppression list you have from any previous service to avoid incorrectly sending mail to unsubscribed/invalid recipients.</banner>

It is also good practice to maintain your own recipient database by unsubscribing or removing recipients based on the bounce, unsubscribe and spam complaint events provided by SparkPost.
These events are available from [webhooks](webhooks), [message events](message-events) and your suppression list. A 24-hour time-windowed suppression list search [as outlined below](#suppression-list-search-get) is useful here.

SparkPost supports bulk importing or manually adding up to 1,000,000 suppression list entries total.

## Suppression Object

+ Data Structure: Attributes
    + recipient (string) - Email address to be suppressed
    + type (enum) - Type of suppression record
        + transactional
        + non_transactional
    + source (enum) - Source responsible for inserting the list entry.
        + Spam Complaint
        + List Unsubscribe
        + Bounce Rule
        + Unsubscribe Link
        + Manually Added
        + Compliance
    + description (string) - Explanation for the suppression
    + transactional (boolean) - Whether the recipient requested to not receive any transactional messages. Deprecated in favor of `type`
    + non_transactional (boolean) - Whether the recipient requested to not receive any non-transactional messages. Deprecated in favor of `type`


## Insert & Update [PUT /suppression-list/]

Bulk insert or update entries in the suppression list by providing an object, with a `recipients` attribute containing an array of recipients to insert or update, as the PUT request body.

If a recipient was added to the list by compliance, it cannot be updated.

+ Data Structure: PUT Request Body
    + recipients: (array, required) - Array of recipient objects to add to or updates in the suppression list. Max size: 50mb. Max length: 10,000.


+ Data Structure: Recipient Object
    + recipient (array, required) - Email address to be suppressed
    + type (enum, required) - Type of suppression record
        + transactional
        + non_transactional
    + description (string) - Explanation for the suppression

Please note that in the unlikely scenario where your receive a HTTP 5xx level error response while bulk loading, only some of your suppression entries may have been successfully inserted or updated.
If this occurs, please re-submit your original request again for processing.

## Retrieve, Delete, Insert or Update [/suppression-list/{recipient_email}]

### Retrieve a Recipient Suppression Status [GET]

Retrieve the suppression status for a specific recipient by specifying the recipientâ€™s email address in the URI path.

This is a search endpoint so delays can occur when searching across multiple suppression lists.  See "Searching with Subaccounts" below.

If the recipient is not in the suppression list, an HTTP status of 404 is returned. If the recipient is in the list, an HTTP status of 200 is returned with the suppression records in the response body. Specifying the `type` query parameter allows for retrieving only the `transactional` or `non_transactional` record. If type is specified and the recipient isn't suppressed for that type, an HTTP status of 404 is returned.

In addition to the list entry attributes, the response body also includes `created` and `updated` timestamps.

##### Searching with Subaccounts:
Please provide the X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT header when performing a lookup on a specific suppression list.
- Use a value of 0 to only search against the master account suppression list.
- Use the subaccount's ID to perform a lookup on a specific subaccount suppression list.

If the X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT header is not provided, a search will be performed across the master account and all subaccount suppression lists. Searches across multiple lists can return out of date results, with a delay of up to 20 minutes. Searches against a specific list are not affected by this delay and return up-to-date information. If you do not take advantage of SparkPost's subaccounts feature, you do not need to provide the X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT header in order to receive up-to-date results.


+ Parameters
  + recipient_email (required, string, `rcpt@example.com`) ... Recipient email address
  + types (optional, list, `transactional`) ... Types of entries to include in the search, i.e. entries that are `transactional` or `non_transactional`
  + cursor (optional, string, `initial`) ... The results cursor location to return, to start paging with cursor, use the value of 'initial'. When cursor is provided the `page` parameter is ignored. ( **Note:** Applicable to multi-list queries only)
  + per_page (optional, int, `5`) ... Maximum number of results to return per page.  Must be between 1 and 10,000. Default value is 1000. ( **Note:** Applicable to multi-list queries only)
  + page (optional, int, `5`) ... The results page number to return. Used with per_page for paging through results. The page parameter works up to 10,000 results. You must use the cursor parameter and start with cursor=initial to page result sets larger than 10,000 ( **Note:** Applicable to multi-list queries only)

### Delete a List Entry [DELETE]

Delete a recipient from the list by specifying the recipient's email address in the URI path.

If the recipient is not in the suppression list, an HTTP status of 404 is returned. If the recipient is in the list, an HTTP status of 204 is returned indicating a successful deletion. Suppression `type` can be specified in the request body. If a type isn't provided, the suppression will be deleted for both transactional and non-transactional.
