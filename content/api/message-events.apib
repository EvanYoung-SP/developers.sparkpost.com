The Message Events API has been deprecated.  Please use the [Events API](/api/events/).

Notice on May 8 2019: We are discontinuing the Message Events API on October 1, 2019. Starting on October 1 the Message Events API will return a 4xx error.  Users must switch to using the Events API instead. Events Searchâ€™s API and UI provide robust searching capabilities of the raw message event data associated with the messages you send via SparkPost.
