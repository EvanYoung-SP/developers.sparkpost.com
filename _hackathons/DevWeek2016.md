# Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

## Challenges
* Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
* I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!
* They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

## Judging Criteria
1. Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
2. You hit me with a cricket bat.
3. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

## Prizes
* There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
* Who are those horrible orange men?
* I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
