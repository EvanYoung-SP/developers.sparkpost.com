Supression lists are not currently available in our web UI. We recommend you have a look at [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). We provide a [Run in Postman button](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/#/introduction/using-postman) in our API documentation that will allow you to test our API through the Postman GUI.
