Our servers are currently hosted in the US region so protocols, like SMTP, that make a lot of round trips will be subject to greater latency. We recommend you use our RESTful interface if possible or send via SMTP from a server in the US. We are working on providing our servers in other regions. Keep an eye on our [change log](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/portal/articles/1936102-change-log) for more updates on this.
