Relay webhooks are different from our regular webhooks. Instead of getting information about each message you send through our system (regular webhooks), with "inbound relay" you get information whenever someone sends an email to a domain you've set up with us.

To learn more about use-cases and how to set them up, [see this support article](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/portal/articles/2039614-enabling-inbound-email-relaying-relay-webhooks).
